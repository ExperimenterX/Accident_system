# Accident Prediction System
The escalating volume of vehicles has intricately transformed traffic management and infrastructure design. This surge has highlighted the pressing concern of road accidents, impacting public health and the economy, sparking concerted efforts to resolve this issue. Technological advancements and cost-effective data storage have resulted in massive accumulations of precisely calibrated data. This surge in data has emphasized the pivotal role of data mining in extracting valuable insights. This study endeavors to identify the most compatible machine learning classification techniques for estimating road accidents through comprehensive data mining analysis.

## Motivation 
Accidents stand as the primary cause of death in India, with a significantly high mortality rate compared to other causes. As reported by the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) in 2018, there were 148,000 recorded accidents, a staggering figure. On average, approximately 120,000 individuals lose their lives each year due to accidents, signifying that 1/8th of all daily deaths are attributed to accidents. Hence, our objective is to significantly diminish the number of fatalities and injuries resulting from accidents.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to create a predictive model pinpointing accident-prone zones, distinguishing them as either high or low-risk areas. This model aims to analyze historical data, identifying patterns and factors contributing to accidents, aiding in proactive measures to mitigate risks and enhance safety in these identified regions.
